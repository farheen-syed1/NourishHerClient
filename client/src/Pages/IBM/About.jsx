<p>BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a way to measure how much body fat you have based on your weight and height. It’s mainly used for adults who are 20 years old and above, but for kids who are 2 years old and older, we use something called BMI percentile to see how much body fat they have.</p>

 <p>The BMI number tells us if you might have too much body fat, with higher numbers indicating more fat. We use a BMI Calculator to figure this out. It’s a helpful tool because it can warn us if your weight might be causing health issues like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer.</p>

<h4>How is BMI Used?</h4>
<p>The BMI, or Body Mass Index, isn’t perfect for diagnosing health issues, but it’s useful for spotting possible weight problems in adults.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, a person might have a high BMI, but to figure out if this extra weight could cause health problems, we need to do more checks like:</p> 
   <ul>
    <li> Looking at what they eat</li>
    <li>How much do they move around</li>
    <li>Their family’s health history</li>
    <li>Other health tests that make sense</li>
   </ul>
   <h4>How to calculate BMI for Adults?</h4>

 <p>You can use a BMI calculator to see if your weight might affect your health.</p>
   <p>If your BMI is less than 18.5, you’re underweight. It might be a good idea to gain some weight. You can talk to a dietitian for advice.</p>
   <p>A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered healthy. By staying in this range, you reduce your risk of serious health issues.</p>
   <p>If your BMI is between 25 and 29.9, you’re slightly overweight. You might need to lose some weight for your health. It’s a good idea to speak with a dietitian.</p>
  <p>A BMI over 30 means you’re in the obese category. This could be risky for your health. Talk to your doctor or a dietitian for advice on losing weight.</p>
